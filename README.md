# Golang Backend with Docker & CLI: A Devâ€™s Approach ðŸš€ ðŸš€

As in this code I have creates a complete golang server using the `go-fiber` library of the go and then adding the all the services to the `cli` cammands using `cobra` the go library.

### Steps to run CLI
- Start the server on docker using `make compose-with-debug`. You can find other cmds as per your convience on the MakeFile.
- Go the folder cli and run `go build -o task`
- Now you can run the cli using `./task`. As the above cmd will give the binary of the CLI.
